            <li>FCID reserve the right to delay or cancel evaluation work if the
          fees invoiced in advance are not paid promptly. </li>
          <li>All outstanding invoices must be paid by the CLIENT in
          full prior to issue of a certificate.</li>
          <li>
          The fees shown are based on our current rates and will be
          reviewed annually. Any increase will be notified in writing prior to
          any work subject to an increased fee being undertaken.
          </li>
          <li>
          The invoice will normally be sent by FCID on a yearly
          basis, on or about the same date every year. Non-payment by the CLIENT
          will result in a delay of the audit, fully attributable to the Client.
          </li>
          <li>
          Non-timely payment may also lead to suspension of the
          CLIENT’s certificate with immediate effect; such suspension period may
          remain in place up to and including the expiry date of the
          certificate.

        <p>
          By signing this Certification, CLIENT agree with its contents. After
          receiving the Annual Fee, FCID will plan the first AUDIT visit and
          inform the CLIENT accordingly. Any agreement between FCID and the
          CLIENT shall be tacitly renewed every year for another period of one
          calendar year, barring termination by the client or FCID and/or
          changes in scope of certification.
          <br></br> Besides, FCID must receive the
          required Tracenet data 3 months prior to expiry of scope certificate
          from the CLIENT, in order to enable us to do inspection in time. Delay
          in forwarding the data will lead to delay in conducting the AUDIT that
          may affect CLIENT’s certification status for which FCID will not be
          liable.
          <br></br> This agreement is only valid when signed by legal
          representative of the CLIENT and authorized signatory of FCID. This
          Certification Agreement shall replace and supersede all previous
          Certification Agreements between FCID and CLIENT.
